# Route Planning Project

In this project A star algorithm has been implemented to find the optimal path between two points on a map using real map data from OpenStreetMap project. The starter code 
provided by Udacity was used as base.  Map in .osm format provided by Udacity is used in this project.

The program requests the coordinates of the desired start and goal point and the code automatically determines the nearby node in map and start to plan the path.

The desired path turns out to be.

## Compiling and Running

### Compiling
To compile the project, first, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake` and `make` as follows:
```
cmake ..
make
```
### Running
The executable will be placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```
./OSM_A_star_search
```
Or to specify a map file:
```
./OSM_A_star_search -f ../<your_osm_file.osm>
```

## Testing

The testing executable is also placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the unit tests as follows:
```
./test
```
